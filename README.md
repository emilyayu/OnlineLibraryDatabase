# Online Library Database

Database developed for Database Course at Oregon State University. The website is no longer housed on the flip server, however, this is the source code.

Overview:
With an ever-increasing move to a digital world, libraries are forced to adapt and provide options to library patrons to access written works. By creating an Online Digital Database, libraries can access information regarding patrons, books, and book trends. This helps the library decide what books to buy in the future, based on demand, and informs the number of e-subscriptions.
This is a database for an online digital library and its patrons. This database allows patrons to find available e-books by searching multiple online libraries. This library app is currently small but is hoping to grow. It currently serves 300 patrons and 6 online libraries that represent a collection of over 40,000 books. A well-organized database would allow the app builders to track 3 main categories: patron (whom), checked out items (what), and e-library (where).
